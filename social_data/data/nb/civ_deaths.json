evening director of health is fairly new and only took over the position approx 3 weeks ago according to the governor he pressured eid mohammad to take the job based on his good prior performance director of health lives in spina yhousef khel but spends the week in sharan each friday he returns home returning to sharan on saturday morning it is assumed that he was returning to sharan when the incident occurred director of health was driving a 2000 white hilux with public health of paktika in pashto written on the side according to witnesses in a station wagon following the car while passing just west of village zwa ka a reported know  taliban  area around 0800l 4 men on 2 motorcycles with their faces covered pulled in behind dir of healths car stopped the car pulled the men out of the car and shot them numerous times in the chest type of weapon unknown at this time but described as rifle they then pushed the bodies into a ditch on the side of the road they then stole the dir of healths car and left in the car and motorcycles apparently no one got a description of the individuals based on witness reports the killers then went into a neighboring village and asked for some water still covered up and probably unsure if anyone recognized them as the killers they then left no further reports were obtained on the killers the  afghan national police  conducted a detailed search of the area and surrounding villages and houses over the course of the day nothing notable was found no real suspects at this point destroyer  part of a task force e.g. \"puma element\" = part of task force puma  hhc  commanding officer  2 87 who was transiting from khayr khot to sharana for vehicle parts searched the area as they went through both at noontime and again when they returned to khayr khot later in the day later in the day the father was brought to the scene and confirmed the identity of the bodies the governor gave the father 200 000 afghani as consolation the governor is taking the incident personally and appears unusually distraught believe he feels personally responsible because he pressured the director to take the job very recently i would add also that i believe this is the first member of the provincial government that the governor has lost as we discussed i will engage and help the governor tomorrow with an  information operations  plan including radio and  meeting of tribal elders and afghan leaders  i am sure he will understand the importance of this i will obtain a copy of the radio message and send it to spartan  information operations  for potential national coverage"}}, {"circle": {"death": 1, "coordinates": [32.92061996, 69.17218781], "desc": "at 1350z  task force  catamount reported that workers in orgun e had been trapped in a well

the easier soft targets  in order to  undermine the goa and to get maximum media coverage i e high yield of casualties the success and the media coverage will most likely result in an increase in

surrounding the death of a local contractor both pers arrived at the scene as the attackers withdrew and reported that members of the sultan ali construction company and akdn were attacked the incident occurred while moving south along ghandak highway  in vicinity of  gr 42s vd 09727 90059 8 approximately six attackers were observed withdrawing northeast from the ambush site armed with 4 x ak47s 1x  light machine gun, kalashnikov (ruchnoi pulemyot kalashnikova)  and 1x  rocket propelled grenade  both sources reported that an additional group of individuals approximately six were

gunshot wound to the leg 10 ghul ahmed and remaining construction workers assisted sultan hussain with the evacuation of the dead and wounded back to ghandak village ghul ahmeds statement 11 ghul ahmed was adamant that the attackers were linked to haji kahar although he did not see any faces s2 comment haji kahar is a criminal nuisance with a long running feud with a nearby village ghul ahmed has reported in the past kt2 intrep 012 that kahar was possibly linked to a group with the intention of ambushing the nzprt along the ghandak highway end comment 12 ahmed believed kahar targeted the ngo because he could not target the  provincial reconstruction team  like he wanted and the ngo was the next best thing he said the construction workers were targeted because they could get a good ransom for sultan ali sultan hussains statement 13 sultan hussain is the brother of sultan ali and  commanding officer  owner of the construction company that was attacked he did notice the fighting pits prior to the attack despite having travelled the road earlier when he looked at them he noted a number of things a there had been a toilet dug behind them that had only had a days use therefore he believed they had been recently built there was also food in them b the size of some of the rocks used he believed would need at least five men to move them therefore he believed there would have to have been at least 10 pers to be able to build the fighting pits overnight"}}, {"circle": {"death": 2, "coordinates": [34.94614029, 69.26496887], "desc": "at 0130z  task force  med requested a

completion of the  route clearance patrol  mission and return to  forward operating base  salerno all components were turned over to cexc for further exploitation fm  task force  paladin device construction and method of operation a s rel the pmr radio had been modified to act as an rcied firing device through the addition of what is a probable a dtmf decoder board attached to the back of the pmr the operator would activate the device by first connecting an additional power source battery pack to the probable uniden pmr dtmf decoder board at this time the operator would connect the blasting cap to the pmr output wires and insert the blasting cap into the main charge when ready to initiate the device the operator would transmit the arming and firing code from another uniden pmr the pmr provides the rc carrier wave with the attached dtmf board providing the firing code dtmf decoding on closing the firing relay enough power output is exported from the attached battery pack through the output wires to the blasting cap detonating the main charge b s rel the probable method of operation was for the  insurgents  to emplace this device in an effort to target  afghan national security forces  personnel vehicles the device is connected to the main charge buried in the road with the pmr camouflaged from view along the side of the road the device was detonated when the victim failed to stop his vehicle for armed men along the route in this case the  improvised explosive device  had been used as a probable  insurgents  cut off for an illegal vehicle check point investigator apos apos s comments a s rel the components and construction of this device are almost identical to those found in cexc_a_1001_07 discovered immediately adjacent to the afghanistan pakistan border no exploitation was performed on the components in that case as they were turned over to the pakistani military photographs taken shows that the pmr modification as well as the power connector and wires appear to be of the same manufacture the battery used in cexc_1001_07 was a modified pack consisting of four 4x individual cells contained in a plastic wrapper close examination of the 5598a u battery recovered in this case reveals a very similar four 4x cell construction contained inside the green plastic housing the modified pmr recovered was considered well constructed and professionally made especially with the added inclusion of a battery pack wire snap clip power connector these similarities make it probable that these devices were constructed by the same individual b s rel this pmr is similar to previously modified pmr radios recovered in the paktya and paktika provinces covered in cexc_afg_786_07 625 417 while the same radio and similar dtmf modifications are found in those previously listed the components and construction of this device most closely resemble those found in cexc_a_1001_07 found along the pakistan border due to their lack of effectiveness on  coalition forces  targets due to cm employed limited numbers of pmr based devices are found in khowst province in this case it is probable that  insurgents  were specifically targeting  afghan national security forces  personnel responding to another nearby  improvised explosive device  detonation and those working in support of  coalition forces  reconstruction projects the victims of both attacks were transporting supplies for the construction of  coalition forces  facilities c s rel the damage to the construction truck is relatively limited in comparison to the effects of a tc6 mine however as it was an rcied the bomber had no control where the vehicle was driving and he chose to function the device when it was closest to the  improvised explosive device  therefore it is possible that the main charge was a tc6 mine which was not functioned in the optimum place as the construction driver did not drive directly over the main charge for furhter details please see attached cexc reports  nothing

this warning was received at approx 180700z feb 08 the specific target was identified as  coalition forces  and the location for the attack given as the area between wesh border with pakistan and  forward operating base  spin buldak the type of suicide attack was identified as being mounted on a motor cycle appropriate warnings were given to all personnel within the area summary suicide attack threat warnings are commonplace within spin buldak particularly as this area is in close proximity to the pakistan border appropriate warnings were given to all personnel within the area it is not feasible to remove  coalition forces  presence from the area for every threat warning received threat warnings are not new to this area with intelligence on ieds attacks common c s 62 was already on patrol when the threat warning was received and were returning to  forward operating base  spin buldak when the attack occurred the  afghan border police  commander is regarded as a reliable intelligence source who has been a target for previous attacks the routes throughout this area are hazardous for  coalition forces  vehicle patrols as roads are limited and movement around  forward operating base  spin buldak is easily channeled c s 62 was already in an elevated level of readiness due to the reports of a possible suicide attack and adopted combat driving positions by reducing there body silhouette intelligence identified a motorcycle as the means of attack and the patrol was alerted to this and was not expecting a car the patrol traveled down the centre line of the route avoiding close proximity to  local national  vehicles within the crowded market place it is probable that these actions lead to  coalition forces  sustaining non serious casualties and recoverable vehicle damages three  coalition forces  casualties were from c s 62d a cordon was promptly established and the necessary support and evacuation expediently executed it is estimated that the charge used was 50 100 kgs of high explosive it is conclusively determined that the attack was a  suicide vehicle-borne ied  as the vehicle was parked and moved forward approx 1 m before exploding c s 62f

fragmentation all three  afghan national army  soldiers were on scene at the time of field questioning and were informed to seek medical attention for post blast screening as soon as possible device construction and method of operation a the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  was destroyed by the detonation of the  improvised explosive device  no identifiable components of an arming or firing mechanism were recovered it is assessed that the main charge in the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  attack was bulk explosives and a small number of large caliber military ordnance 100 130mm projectiles no evidence of device construction was collected during the scene search other than the main charge fragmentation from military ordnance it is assessed from previous device make ups that the device make up was a command pressure release switch manually triggered by the suicide bomber in the vehicle either connected into the vehicle interior structure or placed simply within the interior of the vehicle once the command switch was triggered the firing circuit would close and allow electricity to flow from the power source to the blasting cap s it is probable detonating cord was used as linking explosive to the projectiles and bulk explosive b it is assessed that the method of operation for the suicide bomber was to drive the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  along a route commonly used by  afghan national security forces  elements with the intent of either targeting a predetermined convoy or targeting an opportune  coalition forces  or  afghan national security forces  convoy comments from  afghan national security forces  and the citp analyst suggest that a spotter and or target facilitator is usually utilized to identify the target for the suicide bomber it is unknown whether the intent of the suicide bomber was to detonate the  improvised explosive device  in a stationery position or on the move utilizing a white toyota corolla as the carrier vehicle allows the suicide bomber to blend into the environment given the commonality of that particular vehicle a the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  vehicle was confirmed as a white toyota corolla vehicle right hand drive however neither a number plate or the vin was recovered during the exploitation to confirm exact identification witnesses from the targeted hmmwv stated that the suicide bomber was heavy set and had a beard was wearing white clothing and a turban the  afghan national army  gunner in the hmmwv waved the white toyota to the side of the road as the vehicle approached their convoy from the apposite direction once the suicide bomber pulled up to the right hand side of the road he waved the  afghan national army  hmmwv forward to pass his vehicle immediately prior to detonating the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  at the time of the detonation the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  was at the 10 oclock position to the  afghan national army  vehicle and there was approximately two meters standoff between the two vehicles b based on the size of the seat of explosion obliteration of the suicide bomber and complete destruction to the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  it is estimated that the net explosive weight new was between 40 60kgs the  improvised explosive device  was considered well designed and constructed given the complete destruction of the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  and lack of main charge evidence due to the recovery of only small pieces of fragmentation and lack of evidence to suggest any ordnance low ordered it is assessed that the projectiles would have been primed with bulk explosives utilization of large caliber munitions possibly 100 and130mm as a main charge properly primed makes for a more effective and efficient detonation and lowers the chance of kick outs and low orders it is probable that bulk explosives home made commercial or military was the primary component of the main charge if home made explosives hme were used then it was well made packaged and had the necessary booster explosives to initiate efficiently the main charge was probably located in the back seat of the vehicle and trunk area evident by the two major crater indents in the road the majority of the car components including the engine block were located west or forward of the seat of explosion c whilst the  improvised explosive device  construction was considered good the execution of the  suicide vehicle-borne ied  attack was not considered very effective minimal damage occurred to the armored hmmwv likely due to the angle of the vehicles at the time of detonation and standoff the optimal time of detonation would have been as the two vehicles were side by side it is questionable whether the hmmwv was the target of choice given that the two other remaining vehicles in the convoy were light skinned rangers it is possible the suicide bomber panicked when he was directed to pull over by the  afghan national army  and prematurely detonated the  improvised explosive device  in fear of the  afghan national army  observing the main charge in the back of the vehicle as they passed by d the particular area along route hammer is a known  suicide vehicle-borne ied  hot spot this event occurred within 2km of three other incidents since 25 sep 06 cexc_05490549_06 cexc_0654_07 and cexc_0135 08 reports refer the only noticeable difference between thisevent and the three previous incidents is that smaller caliber military ordnance were used in the main charge compared to larger caliber munitions and primarily bulk explosives however this incident is similar to other previous  suicide vehicle-borne ied  events in the province where a mixture of bulk explosives and military ordnance has been used as the main charge the utilization of bulk explosives as the main component with minimal military ordnance or a small amount of large caliber projectile is considered the optimal method of  improvised explosive device "}}, {"circle": {"death": 7, "coordinates": [34.71046066,
